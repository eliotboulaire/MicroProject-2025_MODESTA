	abstract = {L’objectif de cette thèse a été d’acquérir une meilleure compréhension des mécanismes écologiques et démographiques qui déterminent les traits d’histoire de vie et la structure des populations de saumon atlantique Salmo salar. Je teste l’hypothèse que la croissance occupe une place centrale dans les variations des retours des adultes en rivière, avec des réponses différentes chez les mâles et les femelles. Le projet s’appuie sur l’analyse de 21 à 47 années de données empiriques provenant du suivi de cinq populations sauvages sud-européennes, et sur la construction d’un modèle de population centré sur la phase marine du cycle de vie. Je démontre qu’une meilleure croissance en mer pendant le premier été favorise une maturation sexuelle précoce (donc un retour en rivière pour la reproduction). Les femelles doivent atteindre une taille plus importante pour déclencherla maturation. La croissance pendant les premiers mois de la migration marine a diminué au cours du temps. Ce signal temporel dans la croissance au premier été en mer est commun à plusieurs populations, soulignant l’effet de pressions environnementales communes. Cette réponse s'accompagne de différences entre populations: la variabilité de l'âge moyen à maturation est en partie due à des facteurs spécifiques à chaque population. Enfin, nous mettons en évidence que la survie des post-smolts, dépendant de la taille des smolts, et le taux de maturation, dépendant du sexe et de la croissance en mer, conditionnent la structure d’âge et de sexe des retours. Cependant la variabilité temporelle du taux de retour et du potentiel reproducteur dépend essentiellement de la variabilité du taux de survie des post-smolts.},

The recruitment of Atlantic salmon in Europe. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 289–304.The stock complex of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, in Europe has experienced a multidecadal decline in recruitment, resulting in the lowest stock abundances observed since 1970. Here, physical forcing, biological interactions, and the resultant growth response of post-smolt salmon are examined with a view to understanding the mechanism controlling recruitment. Sea surface temperature (SST) has increased in the Northeast Atlantic, with the pattern and seasonal change in SST negatively correlated with post-smolt survival during summer and in a region that spatially matches the post-smolt nursery. Constituents of the pelagic foodweb, including potential post-smolt food and plankton that may affect post-smolt forage, have changed on a decadal scale and correlate with salmon survival. Retrospective growth analyses of eight stock/sea age components show that post-smolt growth during summer is positively correlated with salmon survival and recruitment. The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation appears to be a more closely aligned climate forcing index than the North Atlantic Oscillation with respect to salmon recruitment. European Atlantic salmon recruitment appears to be governed by factors that affect the growth of post-smolts during their first summer at sea, including SST and forage abundances; growth appears to mediate survival by the functional relationship between post-smolts and their predators.},

	abstract = {Recent decline in abundance of Atlantic salmon and concomitant changes in life history may result from a decline in the growth conditions during marine migration. Available literature suggests the existence of a sex-specific reaction norm linking maturation with environmental growth conditions at sea. However the extent to which this mechanism explains variations in age at maturity remains unclear. Using a historical collection of scales (1987-2017) from the Sélune River, France, we showed that marine growth declined over the first summer, and remained stable during the subsequent periods at sea among returning salmon. Results support the hypothesis of a sex-specific probabilistic reaction norm, with individual probability to return after one year at sea increasing when growth increases. Females may require higher growth than males to attain their maturation threshold. This mechanism is a good candidate to explain temporal variability in sea-age at return at both the individual and population level in the Sélune population and in many other southern European populations.},

	abstract = {Migration enables animals to access important resources throughout their lifetime but exists in a trade-off with elevated mortality risk. In spring, juvenile Atlantic salmon (smolts) migrate from their natal rivers for marine feeding grounds, with the timing of their marine entry a potentially important determinant of their long-term survival. However, there is relatively little known on how the interaction of biological and environmental factors affect smolt migration phenology at the individual level, and how these vary throughout the duration of the smolt seaward migration (run). Using 15-year tag, recapture, and detection datasets of individual smolts (marked with passive integrated transponder tags) from a chalk stream in southern England, the influences of a range of biological and environmental variables were tested on the run timing of individual smolts, measured as the timing of their arrival in a lower river reach. The probability of smolts arriving earlier in the lower river reach was elevated following winters that were relatively warm, and when there were larger positive daily changes in water temperature and discharge during the run. Early migrants tended to be larger individuals and from sites lower in the catchment, from where the smolts had to migrate relatively shorter distances. Later migrants were more likely to migrate in schools, but with schooling behaviour also more likely to occur during daylight than at night. The relative influence of some of these variables altered throughout the run. Relative changes in daily water temperature were not important during the middle period of the smolt run but were important at the start and end of the run. Relative changes in daily discharge were most influential towards the end of the run, when even relatively small changes in discharge had a strong influence on migration. These results reveal the importance of a wide range of biological and environmental variables on the phenology of smolt migrations, and how their influence can alter throughout the run. With predictions of annually increasing river temperatures, more frequent and intense discharge events, and associated shifts to earlier migration, these results emphasise that such changes in climate are likely to have substantial consequences on the future success of smolt migrations and thereby future numbers of returning adult spawners.},

	abstract = {Life history traits are properties of organisms directly related to their survival and reproduction rate. Global warming has been changing Atlantic salmon Salmo salar life history traits by delaying maturation, reducing individual length and decreasing marine survival. S. salar is a migratory fish, hatching in river and growing in sea before returning to its natal river to spawn. They are rarely observed during their marine phase. The aim of this study is to estimate growth and length of salmons in the marine environment through modelling based on adult scales of returning fish. Scales bring indirect information concerning growth. In overall, 1738 individuals (smolts and adults) were caught between 1996 and 2018 in Scorff river using fish trap. Back-calculation models were found in the literature and allowed the length estimation of individuals for each focus-circuli distance on scale. Model validation was made at an individual level using PIT tagged individuals and at the population level by comparing the distribution of back-calculated smolt lengths to the distribution of observed smolt lengths. These validation steps recommended the use of models using a biological intercept for smolt lengths backcalculation. Recommendations were made for model improvement in further studies, especially in order to take into account the size-dependent selection which happen at sea. Back-calculation models would be useful to improve population dynamics models, by accounting for a structuration by size. Salmo salar population growth rate and viability could be estimated, which would enable to improve species management and fisheries regulation.},

	abstract = {Recent declines in Atlantic salmon Salmo salar populations are generally attributed to factors in their marine life-phase. However, it is postulated that factors affecting their freshwater life-phase might impact their marine survival, such as the influence of body size. While larger smolts are widely hypothesized to have higher marine survival rates, empirical support remains scant, in part due to inadequate data and ambiguous statistical analyses. Here, we test the influence of smolt body size on marine return rates, a proxy for marine survival, using a 12-year dataset of 3688 smolts tagged with passive integrated transponders in the River Frome, Southern England. State-space models describe the probability of smolts surviving their marine phase to return as 1 sea-winter (1SW) or multi-sea-winter adults as a function of their length, while accounting for imperfect detection and missing data. Models predicted that larger smolts had higher return rates; the most parsimonious model included the effect of length on 1SW return rate. This prediction is concerning, as freshwater juvenile salmon are decreasing in size on the River Frome, and elsewhere. Thus, to maximize adult returns, restoration efforts should focus on freshwater life-stages, and maximize both the number and the size of emigrating smolts.},

	abstract = {Over the past decades, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar, Salmonidae) has emerged as a model system for sexual maturation research, owing to the high diversity of life history strategies, knowledge of trait genetic architecture, and their high economic value. The aim of this synthesis is to summarize the current state of knowledge concerning maturation in Atlantic salmon, outline knowledge gaps, and provide a roadmap for future work. We summarize the current state of knowledge: 1) maturation in Atlantic salmon takes place over the entire life cycle, starting as early as embryo development, 2) variation in the timing of maturation promotes diversity in life history strategies, 3) ecological and genetic factors influence maturation, 4) maturation processes are sex-specific and may have fitness consequences for each sex, 5) genomic studies have identified large-effect loci that influence maturation, 6) the brain-pituitary–gonadal axis regulates molecular and physiological processes of maturation, 7) maturation is a key component of fisheries, aquaculture, conservation, and management, and 8) climate change, fishing pressure, and other anthropogenic stressors likely have major effects on salmon maturation. In the future, maturation research should focus on a broader diversity of life history stages, including early embryonic development, the marine phase and return migration. We recommend studies combining ecological and genetic approaches will help disentangle the relative contributions of effects in different life history stages to maturation. Functional validation of large-effect loci should reveal how these genes influence maturation. Finally, continued research in maturation will improve our predictions concerning how salmon may adapt to fisheries, climate change, and other future challenges.},

	title = {Changes in sex ratio and fecundity of salmonids},
	abstract = {In salmonids, life history traits (e.g. growth, age or size at maturation) differ strongly between sexes. They are also susceptible to vary between populations and/or over time as a response to changes in the marine environment. However, those variations between sex, populations and time are difficult to observe from empirical monitoring. Consequently, population dynamic models used to set conservation limits and fishing quotas (known as Stock Assessment Models or SAMs) most often assume that vital rates do not differ between males and females, and/or consider fixed values of sex ratio and fecundity. These strong assumptions could lead to inappropriate management decisions based on biased population productivity estimates.  Thanks to new data and methods developed in the SAMARCH project, we assessed the long-term trends in the sex ratio at different salmonid life stages (smolts and adults) in the SAMARCH rivers. Individual measurements of length and fecundity available on a large sample of females were also collated. Statistical models were developed to characterize changes in sex ratios and female fecundity and to investigate the factors contributing to these changes (e.g. body size, age). Results highlight that the sex ratio of returning fish was relatively stable for each sea age class over time, but that the average fecundity declined by 15\% between 1985 and 2018, mostly driven by a decline in the mean body length and weight of returning multi sea-winter females. This suggests that SAMs might systematically overestimate egg deposition, particularly in recent years, which could lead to overstate compliance with conservation limits. The novel data on sex ratio and fecundity will be incorporated in new SAMs to reduce their possible bias. This will encourage managers to derive more realistic conservation limits that recognize the changing ratio of females and the changes in mean body size within each sea age class.},

	abstract = {This study provides a regional picture of long‐term changes in Atlantic salmon growth at the southern edge of their distribution, using a multi‐population approach spanning 49 years and five populations. We provide empirical evidence of salmon life history being influenced by a combination of common signals in the marine environment and population‐specific signals. We identified an abrupt decline in growth from 1976 and a more recent decline after 2005. As these declines have also been recorded in northern European populations, our study significantly expands a pattern of declining marine growth to include southern European populations, thereby revealing a large‐scale synchrony in marine growth patterns for almost five decades. Growth increments during their sea sojourn were characterized by distinct temporal dynamics. At a coarse temporal resolution, growth during the first winter at sea seemed to gradually improve over the study period. However, the analysis of finer seasonal growth patterns revealed ecological bottlenecks of salmon life histories at sea in time and space. Our study reinforces existing evidence of an impact of early marine growth on maturation decision, with small‐sized individuals at the end of the first summer at sea being more likely to delay maturation. However, each population was characterized by a specific probabilistic maturation reaction norm, and a local component of growth at sea in which some populations have better growth in some years might further amplify differences in maturation rate. Differences between populations were smaller than those between sexes, suggesting that the sex‐specific growth threshold for maturation is a well‐conserved evolutionary phenomenon in salmon. Finally, our results illustrate that although most of the gain in length occurs during the first summer at sea, the temporal variability in body length at return is buffered against the decrease in post‐smolt growth conditions. The intricate combination of growth over successive seasons, and its interplay with the maturation decision, could be regulating body length by maintaining diversity in early growth trajectories, life histories, and the composition of salmon populations.},
